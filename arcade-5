//Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

//A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.

int shapeArea(int n) {
    int x=0;
    if(n==1)
    {
        x=1;
    }    
    else if(n==2)
    {
        x=5;
    }    
    else if(n>=3)
    {
        
        x = n*4-3+((n-1)*n/2-(n-1))*4;
            
    }
    return x;
}
